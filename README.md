# buster-cljs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BirdseyeSoftware/buster-cljs.png)](https://travis-ci.org/BirdseyeSoftware/buster-cljs)

buster-cljs provides an easy and convenient way to test your
Clojure/Clojurescript source code by using the same testsuite code
base.

This library not only offers a similar interface as the one found in
the `clojure.test' library, but also the powerful buster.js test
architecture.

## Project Goals

There are some ports of `clojure.test' already out there, so why build
yet another one? Birdseye Software strongly believes that the most
important thing is not the test API but rather, what facilities the
test platform provides; buster allows you to:

* Use different browsers<sup>1</sup> as slaves to run your tests; just set up
  the buster.js node server, connet to it through the browser you want
  to slave (might be a machine or a mobile phone), and click a
  button. No plugins required to be installed on your browser.

* Run your testsuite in both your browser and node.

* Easy integration with phantomjs for headless testing.

## Project Maturity

buster-cljs is a very young library; started in November 2012, used
from the start to test all the Clojure/Clojurescript libraries that
Birdseye Software develops.
